# MyTorch:  Autograd and MLPs

Autograd: a functioning Autograd library.

MLPs: Expands the Autograd to complete an MLP library with Linear, ReLU, and BatchNorm layers. It will also have cross entropy loss and an SGD optimizer with momentum.

MNIST: Uses the MLP library to train on the MNIST dataset.

Includes MyTorch components for HW2 and HW3
